gedit3-codefolding
==================

This plugin adds code folding support to gedit 3.x. It supports several (meaning more than 1) languages. Note that this plugin is <b>not</b> compatible with gedit 2.x.

## Features
Besides folding indivudual blocks by clicking the respective block start markers on the left margin, two other operations are supported either from the Tools menu or from the keyboard like this
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>: Toggle all blocks
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>: Fold current block

## Suported languages
- C/C++
- CSS
- Graphviz Dot
- Java
- Javascript
- JSON
- Lua
- Objective-C
- Perl
- Prolog
- R
- Ruby
- sh
- Scheme
- SQL
- XML

## Installation

## Notes
- Code folding is dependent on properly formatted blocks of code. If the folding behaves erratic try reformatting the code
- A simple way of reformatting to facilitate folding is to have block start and end constructs in seperate individual lines
- A light color scheme works best (actually dark schemes don't show the markers at all) with this plugin, for now
